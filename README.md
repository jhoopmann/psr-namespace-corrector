# psr-namespace-corrector
simply overwrites namespaces and found use statements to psr path of directory and class - phpstorm missing "adjust namespaces" functionality. Files should be checked after execution manually.

written 4 own conditions. only supports single file namespaces without brackets. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
node correct_namespaces.js /path/to/psr/root/
